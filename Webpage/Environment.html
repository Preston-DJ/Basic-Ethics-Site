                The influence of computing on the environment has become increasingly significant in recent years. The rapid growth of digital technologies, coupled with the rise in data processing and storage demands, has led to substantial energy consumption and electronic waste generation. The production and operation of computing devices, such as servers and data centers, contribute to carbon emissions and the depletion of natural resources. To ensure the sustainability of computing, it is crucial to adopt environmentally friendly practices. This can be achieved through various means, such as improving energy efficiency in hardware and software design, promoting virtualization and cloud computing to optimize resource utilization, and implementing responsible end-of-life management for electronic devices. Additionally, adopting renewable energy sources for powering data centers and promoting recycling and proper disposal of electronic waste are vital steps toward reducing the environmental impact of computing.
